# Breakout-Challenges

Weird "shells" to breakout of to obtain a flag (gdbserver, ranger, and radare2)

* [Breakout-1](./breakout_1/) requires the competitor to connect to a gdbserver instance, disassemble the binary and identify the flag.


Each directory contains a "solve.md" folder with instructions on how to solve that given challenge.
To build the challenge, simply execute `docker compose up` and you're off to the races.
